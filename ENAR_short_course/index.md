### OVERVIEW

The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) has created a vast resource for the study of treatments and health outcomes in the general population. The 21st Century Cures Act and the FDAâ€™s subsequent publication of a framework for using real world data (RWD) to generate real world evidence (RWE) has spurred additional interest in using EHR to generate RWE. While there are many benefits to conducting research with RWD, many challenges arise due to the complex and messy processes that give rise to EHR data. To make valid inference, statisticians must be aware of data generation, capture, integration, and availability issues and utilize appropriate study designs and statistical analysis methods to account for these issues.

In this half-day short course, we will discuss four key issues for research conducted using RWD: (1) approaches to phenotyping using EHR; (2) missing data and data capture considerations; (3) error in covariates and outcomes extracted from EHR data; (4) accounting for confounding due to non-random treatment allocation. For each issue we will present a motivating case study to focus our discussion and use this to spur thinking about the pros and cons of using RWD for a given research question and alternative methodological choices that can strengthen inference. The overarching goal is to provide participants with a framework for thinking about the design and analysis of EHR-based studies to help guide their use of statistical best practices in the conduct of their own research.
