## ANALYSIS OF BIG HEALTHCARE DATABASES
### Rebecca Hubbard, PhD

### OVERVIEW

The widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) as a means of documenting medical care has created a vast resource for the study of health conditions, interventions, and outcomes in routine clinical practice. Using healthcare databases, including EHR and administrative claims data, for research facilitates the efficient creation of large research databases, execution of pragmatic clinical trials, and study of rare diseases. Despite these advantages, there are many challenges for research conducted using these data. To make valid inference, statisticians must be aware of data generation, capture, and availability issues and utilize appropriate study designs and statistical analysis methods to account for these issues. In this course, we will discuss topics related to the design and analysis of research studies using big healthcare databases and build expertise in analyzing these data in R through a series of hands-on exercises. We will cover issues related to the structure and quality of the data, including data types and methods for extracting variables of interest; sources of missing data; error in covariates and outcomes extracted from EHR and claims data; and data capture considerations such as informative visit processes and medical records coding procedures. We will discuss and implement statistical approaches to address some of the challenges and unique features of healthcare databases, including missing data and error in automated algorithm-derived covariates and outcomes. The overarching objective of this course is to provide participants with an introduction to the structure and content of healthcare databases and equip them with a set of appropriate tools to investigate and analyze this rich data resource.
